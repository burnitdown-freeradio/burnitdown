'Burn It Down' is a community non-commercial free radio, transmitting from New York City.
<br>
<br>
We are an autonomous, non-hierarchical, multi-cultural collective focusing on amplifying our community's cultural and artistic expression in these challenging times.
<br>

We are bringing curated music and live streams from many different backgrounds and genres.
<br>

Our programming is free of racism, nationalism, homophobia, sexism.
<br>

We would have a monthly program with live music directly from our social center, weekly selected playlists, interviews, and much more.</h2></td>
